# Vending_Machine_CSC232
A vending machine project for my Object Oriented Software Development class


This is a Java Object Oriented project that works similar to a vending machine. The user can insert nickels, dimes and quarters and the machine can store them. The machine is able to dispense change and select items from the items available for the user, if the user adds sufficient amount or if the machine can dispense required change.
